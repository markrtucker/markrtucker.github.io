I wrote this short essay as part of my test for my Taekwondo First Dan (Black Belt) in November, 2018. I've done some reformatting and some light editing to the original to make it fit a bit better in a blog format.

"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step" 
-- Laozi

As a child, I was always physically active - baseball in the summer, soccer in the fall, and tennis or track in the spring. In the fall of my senior year,  I tore some cartilage in my knee, which effectively ended my high school sports career. That, combined with going off to college, started a long stretch of physical inactivity. So by the time I started Taekwondo at age 42, I had been physically inactive for close to 25 years. I had known for a while that I needed to start regular exercise, but I never found the motivation to do it. I needed a set schedule so that I “had” to go exercise.

I didn’t quite know what to expect when I first put on the dobok: part of me thought I would try classes for a few months, get bored, and quit; another part of me expected to get injured and be forced out of action, or to quickly realize that I didn’t have the physical ability to train effectively. I was certain that I would never be ready for a Black Belt test - I could barely do 1 push-up, never mind 300.

In reality, I quickly learned to love Taekwondo. The continuous learning, the steady improvement in my strength, balance, and stamina, and the joy of sparring provided the internal motivation I needed to continue training.

“There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.” 
— Bruce Lee

I also quickly ran into barriers - physical barriers around conditioning, strength, flexibility, balance; mental barriers around my own perception of limits to my physical abilities; and emotional barriers caused by constant aches and pains that followed me for days after a hard training session.

The mental barriers were the most challenging ones to break through. I knew that my strength and flexibility would improve with time, and I knew that I could learn to manage through minor injuries. But encountering “limits” to my progress was much harder to handle.

I distinctly remember when Master Nguyen first taught me axe kicks. At the time, even waist-high kicks were a struggle for me. We started around waist height and with every kick, he raised the paddle 6 inches. Before I knew it, I was kicking shoulder height, and then head height. I frequently use this memory as a reminder that I can always push beyond what I think are my own limits. I continue to use this inner strength to push myself through various plateaus. I still find myself getting comfortable at a certain level of intensity and continuing at that level for several weeks, or even months. I reflect back on this time and challenge myself to move beyond these plateaus - to reach the next level: kick higher, move faster, train harder.

In my professional life, we use the word Kaizen to mean continuous improvement - it is the practice of making yourself (and by extension, your team and your company) a little bit better every day. We practice constant reflection - what went well today, this past week? What didn’t go so well? How can we make things better tomorrow? 

This philosophy supports my martial arts practice. Every day, I work to find something I can do to make myself a little bit better. I also leverage this philosophy to help others improve in their own practice.

“...this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”
— Winston Churchill

One lesson that sticks with me is that Taekwondo is a journey. Becoming a black belt is not the final step of that journey. I am no longer a beginner. I have so much more to learn. This is not the end of my journey. I intend to continue traveling this path for as long as my body allows.

Looking back, I have grown stronger, both physically and mentally. Beyond the obvious improvements in my strength, stamina, balance, flexibility, I have grown more confident. Four years ago, I didn’t believe that I would ever be able to complete the physical portion of this test. Now, one week before my test, I feel confident that I am ready for this challenge.

Looking forward, I will continue training physically to improve my strength, stamina, flexibility, and technique. I will continue training mentally to improve my resilience, overcome fears, and push past plateaus along the way. I will freely offer my knowledge and time to help improve the Taekwondo community at a local, state, and national level. 

I am grateful to all of those who have been generous with sharing their time and experience to teach me. I look forward to continuing that tradition.
