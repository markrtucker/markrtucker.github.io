First Dan Black Belt Test

As a child, I was always physically active - baseball in the summer, soccer in the fall, and tennis or track in the spring. At 17,  I tore some cartilage in my knee. That, combined with going off to college, started a long stretch of physical inactivity. 

So by the time I started Taekwondo at age 42, I had been physically inactive for close to 25 years. I had known for a while that I needed to start regular exercise, but I never found the motivation to do it. I needed a set schedule so that I “had” to go exercise.

I didn’t quite know what to expect when I first put on the dobok: part of me thought I would try classes for a few months, get bored, and quit; another part of me expected to get injured and be forced out of action, or to quickly realize that I didn’t have the physical ability to train effectively. I was certain that I would never be ready for a Black Belt test - I could barely do 1 push-up, never mind 300.

In reality, I quickly learned to love Taekwondo. The continuous learning, the steady improvement in my strength, balance, and stamina, and the joy of sparring provided the internal motivation I needed to continue training.

I also quickly ran into barriers - physical barriers around conditioning, strength, flexibility, balance; mental barriers around my own perception of limits to my physical abilities; and emotional barriers caused by constant aches and pains that followed me for days after a hard training session.

The mental barriers were the most challenging ones to break through. I knew that my strength and flexibility would improve with time, and I knew that I could learn to manage through minor injuries. But encountering “limits” to my progress was much harder to handle.

I distinctly remember when Master Nguyen first taught me axe kicks. At the time, even waist-high kicks were a struggle for me. We started around waist height and with every kick, he raised the paddle 6 inches. Before I knew it, I was kicking shoulder height, and then head height. I frequently use this memory as a reminder that I can always push beyond what I think are my own limits. I continue to use this inner strength to push myself through various plateaus. I still find myself getting comfortable at a certain level of intensity and continuing at that level for several weeks, or even months. I reflect back on this time and challenge myself to move beyond these plateaus - to reach the next level: kick higher, move faster, train harder. 

In my professional life, we use the word Kaizen to mean continuous improvement - it is the practice of making yourself (and by extension, your team and your company) a little bit better every day. We practice constant reflection - what went well today, this past week? What didn’t go so well? How can we make things better tomorrow? 

This philosophy supports my martial arts practice. Every day, I work to find something I can do to make myself a little bit better. I also leverage this philosophy to help others improve in their own practice.

One lesson that sticks with me is that Taekwondo is a journey. Becoming a black belt is not the final step of that journey. I am no longer a beginner. I have so much more to learn. This is not the end of my journey. I intend to continue traveling this path for as long as my body allows.

Looking back, I have grown stronger, both physically and mentally. Beyond the obvious improvements in my strength, stamina, balance, flexibility, I have grown more confident. Four years ago, I didn’t believe that I would ever be able to complete the physical portion of this test. Now, one week before my test, I feel confident that I am ready for this challenge.

Looking forward, I will continue training physically to improve my strength, stamina, flexibility, and technique. I will continue training mentally to improve my resilience, overcome fears, and push past plateaus along the way. I will freely offer my knowledge and time to help improve the Taekwondo community at a local, state, and national level. 

I am grateful to all of those who have been generous with sharing their time and experience to teach me. I look forward to continuing that tradition.
