## A brief history of me

I am a second-generation computer geek. Both of my parents have electrical engineering degrees. (My mom, as a female engineering student in the 60's, had a unique experience - but that's not my story.) I grew up surrounded by [Heathkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit) projects - and built a few of my own.

My first computing experience was with a [Heathkit H89](http://oldcomputers.net/heathkit-h89.html). Since I was only 6 or 7 years old at the time my parents assembled this, I was initially only interested in playing games. But within a couple of years, I became deeply interested in creating my own games. I taught myself [Basic](http://sebhc.lesbird.com/documentation/software/HDOS-2/HDOS_Reference_Chapter6.pdf) by borrowing books from the public library and typing in the programs, eventually writing a few original programs. During high school, I got away from programming, but ended up majoring in Computer Science in college. I started my first "real" job in the software industry in the mid-90's, just before the dot-com bubble.

I've worked across several industries in my 25+ year career - industrial process control, enterprise OLTP-like systems, and artificial intelligence. After a 3-year trek into management, I'm now back into coding and I am currently the architect and lead engineer for the IBM Watson Visual Recognition service. (Standard disclaimers apply - anything I publish here is my own opinion and not an official statement from IBM.)

Outside of work, I am a husband, father, and taekwondo athlete. I am lucky enough to be married to an amazing woman. She challenges me, teaches me, and amazes me. Every. Damn. Day. My life changed dramatically when our twins were born in 2001. Watching these two develop from black-and-white blobs on an ultrasound into nearly-full-grown almost-adults is fascinating. 

I was always fairly active as a kid - playing soccer, baseball, tennis, whatever... After getting married, I fell into a sedentary lifestyle and did pretty much nothing physically active for 20+ years. Since one of my kids was practicing taekwondo (and had already earned a black belt), I signed up for classes. I knew I needed something scheduled so that I was "forced" to get up and move. Four years later, I've earned my own black belt - though that's a story for another day.

## Why am I here? Why now?

I've thought about blogging for a while, but never quite got myself organized enough to do it. I could claim that I was too busy with work, kids, life...but that would just be an excuse. In reality, I'm at a point in my career/life where I have some experiences that are worth sharing - and I'm motivated to do so. I have also learned (from my wife) that writing is a great way to learn. So I will also be writing about topics that I do not fully understand.

I don't have a fixed set of writing topics. I would like to explore the software industry, and especially my current experience with [Go](https://golang.org/) as well as my views on Software Architecture. I'll likely explore other computer-y geekness - side projects, electronics, etc. Since my kids are starting the college search, I may touch on that as well. I'll likely talk about various hobbies along the way - taekwondo, woodworking, games (tabletop board game and/or video games).

## Closing thoughts

I'm new to this whole blogging things. I'd like to get a comments section set up. That will be a project for another day. 

In the meantime, I hope you find this blog useful! Feel free to reach out to me here on Github, or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-tucker-12799015/).
