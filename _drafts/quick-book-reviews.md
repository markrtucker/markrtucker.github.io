I read a lot - or at least some....I tend to get through about 20-25 books a year. A lot of these are audiobooks, which are fantastic companions for my (relatively) short commute. I don't have the capacity to write detailed book reviews, but I like to share some quick thoughts as I can. I don't review every book that I read. 

You can see my [Goodreads list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/10301638-mark?shelf=read) for all of the books I've read recently.

[Neverwhere](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14497.Neverwhere) by Neil Gaiman
Rating: [3-stars]
Summary: Richard Mayhew, a "boring" Englishman finds himself sucked into an unknown underground world of the supernatural.
Review: A mildly entertaining, light fantasy set in modern-day London. I found the ending a bit unfulfilling. I'd like to learn a bit more about how Richard moved on (or didn't) with his life. The audio book included [How the Marquis Got His Coat Back](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26699591-how-the-marquis-got-his-coat-back), a short-story set in the same universe. On it's own, that story would have earned a 2-star review. Like most audiobooks, I'm generally unimpressed when author's read their own material. While Mr. Gaiman is quite talented, there is a clear difference between strong author/narrators vs. professional narrators.
